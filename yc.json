We look at a person\u2019s actual cancer cells, test combinations of FDA approved drugs, and see which combinations kill the cancer cells and leave the healthy cells alive. We focus on combinations because cancer is often difficult to target with just one drug and starting with a single drug can lead to resistant clones or relapse. We're building a highly automated lab in Foster City running on our custom software and are currently testing relapsed/refractory cancer patients as well as samples from a variety of pharma/biotech partnerships.\n\nhttps://www.notablelabs.com/careers",

We look at a person\u2019s actual cancer cells, test combinations of FDA approved drugs, and see which combinations kill the cancer cells and leave the healthy cells alive. We focus on combinations because cancer is often difficult to target with just one drug and starting with a single drug can lead to resistant clones or relapse. We're building a highly automated lab in Foster City running on our custom software and are currently testing relapsed/refractory cancer patients as well as samples from a variety of pharma/biotech partnerships.\n\nhttps://www.notablelabs.com/careers",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India.

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

In addition, the team made news when Cancer Physicians who sit on the committee for patient treatment guidelines (NCCN) presented a clinical study using Cofactor\u2019s technology showing superiority in predicting the patients who will respond to immunotherapy. This initial application is an acute problem recognized widely in the rapidly developing immunotherapy industry and represents north of a billion dollar TAM. \n\nAfter a number of recent key milestones, the team is taking the technology more broadly to 50% of cancers diagnosed in the US. \n\nCurrent investors include Menlo Ventures, DCVC, and Ascension Ventures (this last investor representing the funding arm for 13 National U.S. Healthcare Systems).",

We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.\n\nWe charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).\n\nIt encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.\n\nOn average, defect rate will fall 75% within 5 months of deploying Assembly at a factory.",

            "tagline": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
            "description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

It\u2019s an excellent, cost effective way to commute, used by hundreds of thousands of Americans, but the industry is largely offline. It\u2019s difficult to find, join, and start vanpools. \n\nWe build software that fixes this, making vanpooling simple and flexible. We believe that in a post Covid world, it will be more important than ever to rethink shared transportation and make it more adaptive.\n\nOur customers are organizations like transit agencies and employers who have existing vanpool fleets. We provide these customers with our SaaS platform that manages their vanpool programs. We capture real time information about open seats, then make those seats available to book through our app. We also make it easy for people to crowdsource and start new vanpools.",

Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays.\n\nThis process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.\n\nWe charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).\n\nIt encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.\n\nOn average, defect rate will fall 75% within 5 months of deploying Assembly at a factory.",
